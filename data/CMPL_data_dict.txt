May 17 - June 17, 2021 - Flat file content changes.
* Previously blank Y/N fields (such as crash or fire) will now show as N.
* Previously blank values for numeric fields will now show as zero.
* Manufacturer name, make, model and component name of the product(s) in a complaint may have changed over time and the new flat file will now reflect them.
* If a complaint had multiple dealer contacts, only a single dealer's contact information will now show.
* Additional minor differences due to data cleanup in a relatively small number of records in the flat file.

June 28, 2021 - Flat file content changes.
The NHTSA system that generates the complaints file underwent an update during the weekend of May 16-17, 2021. The update has caused discrepancies between the contents of the complaints file between the version posted on Friday, May 15, 2021 (before the system update) and the versions posted daily since Monday, May 17, 2021 (after the system update) and continuing to date. Lookup of complaints on the NHTSA public website are unaffected.
We are working to resolve the issue. In the meantime, we will continue to publish data daily as it will contain newly received complaints by NHTSA. The complaint data is included in the single FLAT_CMPL.zip and the COMPLAINTS_RECEIVED_YYYY-YYYY.zip files, which contain the same data broken down into 5-year chunks by received date. Note that the format of the complaint files has not and will not change. Once resolved, you may still see minor data differences between the latest version and that from prior to the system update.
We will continue to update this message as needed until the issue is resolved.
