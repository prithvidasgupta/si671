1914209,2023-08-01,after owning and driving the 2023 ioniq 5 for about 4 months the car was driven from massachusetts to arizona after driving across the county at 75 mph about 50 min on cruse control the car began to lurch the speed would drop about 3 mph below the cruse control set point then accelerate to a mile faster than the set point and then settle down to the set point this would happen multiple times during the next 100 miles before stopping to charge after charging and again on cruse control at 75 mph or so the lurching would begin again  after the lurching started the power display indicated the front motor on this dual motor vehicle was doing all the work to drive the car and the rear motor was no longer functioning later it was confirmed that the rear eop electric oil pump which cools the rear motor was not functioning at all as a result the rear motor would increase to more than 170 degrees f and stop operating  no dtc was stored for the eop actual speed of zero despite an eop command speed for 800-3000 rpms  no dtc was stored for the mcu motor temperature overheat  no dtc was stored for the mcu motor actual torque of zero when it was commanded for something more   fortunately the hyundai ioniq 5 did command the front motor to take over even though the rear motor was no longer functional so the car was able to maintain speed most of the time however the car is normally 325 hp with both motors accelerating with only the 95hp front motor on a heavy car was very slow both in traffic and on the highway the lack of performance could easily surprise an unsuspecting driver resulting in a collision or worse  i know of at least 5 owners who have experienced this issue in each case hyundai has been slow at best and refused to repair at worst the issue is without dtc but can none the less be easily diagnosed by observing the odb eop actual speed when the car is driven will be zero with an eop command speed 0  ,hyundai motor america,power train
